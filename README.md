This project was made according to the handbook criteria with the implementation of LAMP stack. We have created a working website, deployed using awardspace.com. Our web application, made for The Computer Gaming Society allows for the public to view, search and filter current available games and also allows the staff to login in and manage rentals, game records and members. Additionally, for one member of staff with admin credentials, it is possible to add and remove the staff, and edit rules the website uses. The main index page within the website displays current games to which the public can click to view more detailed description. There is also “about” page with information about the Society and members of the staff. Then, for viewing and managing database records, we have the dashboard page accessible only after login.

## Guide

#### Society members
As a user you can view all the games the Society has to offer, browse them by title, 
filter by type or platform and sort alphabetically or by the release year. 
You can click on the game you are interested to read more about it and check the reviews.

Each game has indicator of whether or not it is currently available to rent, 
so you can know in advance before contacting the Society.

#### Society staff & volunteers
As a staff member, you can access the staff dashboard after logging in 
to view and manage rentals data. 

The application provides a way to view, 
extend and return the rentals, add members and games, as well as edit already existing game records.
It is also easy to see any overdue rentals and outstanding fees.
Staff can also view banned members and record their payments of fees.

Staff Admin has access to the dashboard's Admin Page which allows to add and delete staff members account, as well as change
website's admin account. Admin can also change the rules the data in the application is subject to, such as
the length of ban period, allowed number of extensions per rental or the allowed number of games member can rent at once.

## About the code
We based the backend of our project on the PHP training videos on Lynda.com 
and to ensure better UI and UX we have used Bootstrap and FontAwesome.
